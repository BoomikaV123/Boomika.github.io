    <h2>Who are Full Stack Developers?</h2>
    <p>Full stack web developers can develop the entire web application and website from scratch.<br> They have deep knowledge of two-three technologies and are comfortable with various other technologies used in<br> software development, forming a T-shaped skill set.</p>

    <legend>Front End Development</legend>
    <img src="frontend.png" alt="">
    <p>Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user interface of a website,through the use of HTML,<br> CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website.</p>

    <legend>Back End Development</legend>
    <img src="backend.png" alt="" height="15%" width="15%">
    <p>Back-end developers are the experts who build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions on websites.<br> Unlike front-end developers, who control everything you can see on a website, <br>back-end developers are involved in data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see.</p>

    <p>A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.<br> A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).</p>

    <h1>Data Structures and Algorithms </h1>
</center>
    <p>Look around you! The whole world revolves around information and data.<br> As a result, data and information are integral to daily life.
        <br> However, that data must be stored somewhere where it can be easily accessed and processed.
         <br>That’s where Data Structures come into the picture! 
        <br> Data Structure is a systematic process of organizing and storing the data in the main memory of the computer so that it can be managed<br> properly and utilized efficiently. One common example of data structure is a LinkedIn List. </p>

        <h2>Types of Data Structures</h2>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Linear Data Structures</legend>
            <p>If the elements in the Data Structure are arranged in a sequential manner one after the other then it is called a Linear Data Structure.

                <br>A sequential arrangement makes it easy to access elements. 
                
                <br>Examples of Linear Data structures are Array, Linked List, Stack, and Queue.</p>
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Non-linear Data Structures</legend>
            <p>Unlike Linear Data Structure, if the elements are not arranged in a sequential manner then it is called a Non-Linear Data Structure.

                <br>Instead, they’re connected in a hierarchical manner where one element connects to multiple elements. 
                
                <br>Examples of Non-Linear Data Structures are Graphs, Trees. </p>
